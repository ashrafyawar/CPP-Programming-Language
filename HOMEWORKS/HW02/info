How to find "hearth of the pyramid":

1- Find the line which is under the middle line of the pyramid : (L+1)/2 + 1

2- Find the middle number(s) which is at the center of the line. If length of line is even, there are 2 numbers at the center. Else, there is one number at the center. Number(s) is the "hearth of the pyramid".

WHY it is not the center of the pyramid?

It is related with the golden ratio. But it must be integer, so rounded.
